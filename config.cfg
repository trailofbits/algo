### Review these options BEFORE you run Algo, as they are very difficult/impossible to change after the server is deployed.

# Change default SSH port for the cloud roles only
# It doesn't apply if you deploy to your existing Ubuntu Server
ssh_port: 4160

# Deploy StrongSwan to enable IPsec support
ipsec_enabled: true

# Deploy WireGuard
# WireGuard will listen on 51820/UDP. You might need to change to another port
# if your network blocks this one. Be aware that 53/UDP (DNS) is blocked on some
# mobile data networks.
wireguard_enabled: true
wireguard_port: 51820

# This feature allows you to configure the Algo server to send outbound traffic
# through a different external IP address than the one you are establishing the VPN connection with.
# More info https://trailofbits.github.io/algo/cloud-alternative-ingress-ip.html
# Available for the following cloud providers:
# - DigitalOcean
alternative_ingress_ip: false

# Reduce the MTU of the VPN tunnel
# Some cloud and internet providers use a smaller MTU (Maximum Transmission
# Unit) than the normal value of 1500 and if you don't reduce the MTU of your
# VPN tunnel some network connections will hang. Algo will attempt to set this
# automatically based on your server, but if connections hang you might need to
# adjust this yourself.
# See: https://github.com/trailofbits/algo/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#various-websites-appear-to-be-offline-through-the-vpn
reduce_mtu: 0

# Algo will use the following lists to block ads. You can add new block lists
# after deployment by modifying the line starting "BLOCKLIST_URLS=" at:
# /usr/local/sbin/adblock.sh
# If you load very large blocklists, you may also have to modify resource limits:
# /etc/systemd/system/dnsmasq.service.d/100-CustomLimitations.conf
adblock_lists:
 - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts"

# Enable DNS encryption.
# If 'false', 'dns_servers' should be specified below.
# DNS encryption can not be disabled if DNS adblocking is enabled
dns_encryption: true

# Block traffic between connected clients. Change this to false to enable
# connected clients to reach each other, as well as other computers on the
# same LAN as your Algo server (i.e. the "road warrior" setup). In this
# case, you may also want to enable SMB/CIFS and NETBIOS traffic below.
BetweenClients_DROP: true

# Block SMB/CIFS traffic
block_smb: true

# Block NETBIOS traffic
block_netbios: true

# Your Algo server will automatically install security updates. Some updates
# require a reboot to take effect but your Algo server will not reboot itself
# automatically unless you change 'enabled' below from 'false' to 'true', in
# which case a reboot will take place if necessary at the time specified (as
# HH:MM) in the time zone of your Algo server. The default time zone is UTC.
