# Reduce the MTU of the VPN tunnel
# Some cloud and internet providers use a smaller MTU (Maximum Transmission
# Unit) than the normal value of 1500 and if you don't reduce the MTU of your
# VPN tunnel some network connections will hang. Algo will attempt to set this
# automatically based on your server, but if connections hang you might need to
# adjust this yourself.
