## be viewed here: https://dnscrypt.info/public-servers
##
## The proxy will automatically pick working servers from this list.
## Note that the require_* filters do NOT apply when using this setting.
##
## By default, this list is empty and all registered servers matching the
## require_* filters will be used instead.
##
## Remove the leading # first to enable this; lines starting with # are ignored.

{# Allow either list to be empty. Output nothing if both are empty. #}

## Always use TCP to connect to upstream servers.
## This can be useful if you need to route everything through Tor.
## Otherwise, leave this to `false`, as it doesn't improve security
## (dnscrypt-proxy will always encrypt everything even using UDP), and can
## only increase latency.

force_tcp = false


## SOCKS proxy
## Uncomment the following line to route all TCP connections to a local Tor node
## Tor doesn't support UDP, so set `force_tcp` to `true` as well.

## How long a DNS query will wait for a response, in milliseconds.
## If you have a network with *a lot* of latency, you may need to

## Response for blocked queries.  Options are `refused`, `hinfo` (default) or
## an IP response.  To give an IP response, use the format `a:<IPv4>,aaaa:<IPv6>`.
## Using the `hinfo` option means that some responses will be lies.
## Unfortunately, the `hinfo` option appears to be required for Android 8+

# blocked_query_response = 'refused'


## Load-balancing strategy: 'p2' (default), 'ph', 'first' or 'random'

lb_strategy = 'p2'

## Set to `true` to constantly try to estimate the latency of all the resolvers
## and adjust the load-balancing parameters accordingly, or to `false` to disable.

## Use the system logger (syslog on Unix, Event Log on Windows)

use_syslog = true


## Delay, in minutes, after which certificates are reloaded

## DNSCrypt: Create a new, unique key for every single DNS query
## This may improve privacy but can also have a significant impact on CPU usage
## Only enable if you don't have a lot of network load

dnscrypt_ephemeral_keys = true


## DoH: Disable TLS session tickets - increases privacy but also latency

tls_disable_session_tickets = true


## DoH: Use a specific cipher suite instead of the server preference
## 49199 = TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

##  4867 = TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
##
## On non-Intel CPUs such as MIPS routers and ARM systems (Android, Raspberry Pi...),
## the following suite improves performance.
## This may also help on Intel CPUs running 32-bit operating systems.
##
## Keep tls_cipher_suite empty if you have issues fetching sources or

## Fallback resolvers
## These are normal, non-encrypted DNS resolvers, that will be only used
## for one-shot queries when retrieving the initial resolvers list, and
## only if the system DNS configuration doesn't work.
## No user application queries will ever be leaked through these resolvers,
## and they will not be used after IP addresses of resolvers URLs have been found.
## They will never be used if lists have already been cached, and if stamps
## don't include host names without IP addresses.
## They will not be used if the configured system DNS works.
## Resolvers supporting DNSSEC are recommended.
##
## People in China may need to use 114.114.114.114:53 here.
## Other popular options include 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1.
##
## If more than one resolver is specified, they will be tried in sequence.

## Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for network connectivity before
## initializing the proxy.
## Useful if the proxy is automatically started at boot, and network
## connectivity is not guaranteed to be immediately available.
## Use 0 to not test for connectivity at all (not recommended),
## and -1 to wait as much as possible.

## Address and port to try initializing a connection to, just to check
## if the network is up. It can be any address and any port, even if
## there is nothing answering these on the other side. Just don't use
## a local address, as the goal is to check for Internet connectivity.
## On Windows, a datagram with a single, nul byte will be sent, only
## when the system starts.
## On other operating systems, the connection will be initialized
## but nothing will be sent at all.

netprobe_address = '1.1.1.1:53'

#        Local DoH server        #
##################################

[local_doh]

## dnscrypt-proxy can act as a local DoH server. By doing so, web browsers

## features will enable these, without bypassing your DNS proxy.

## Addresses that the local DoH server should listen to

# listen_addresses = ['127.0.0.1:3000']


## Path of the DoH URL. This is not a file, but the part after the hostname
## in the URL. By convention, `/dns-query` is frequently chosen.
## For each `listen_address` the complete URL to access the server will be:
## `https://<listen_address><path>` (ex: `https://127.0.0.1/dns-query`)

# path = "/dns-query"


## Certificate file and key - Note that the certificate has to be trusted.
## See the documentation (wiki) for more information.

  ## On non-Windows systems, can be /dev/stdout to log to the standard output (also set log_files_max_size to 0)

  # file = 'query.log'


  ## Query log format (currently supported: tsv and ltsv)

## Blacklists are made of one pattern per line. Example of valid patterns:
##
##   example.com
##   =example.com
##   *sex*
##   ads.*
##   ads*.example.*
##   ads*.example[0-9]*.com
##
## Example blacklist files can be found at https://download.dnscrypt.info/blacklists/
## A script to build blacklists from public feeds can be found in the
## `utils/generate-domains-blacklists` directory of the dnscrypt-proxy source code.

[blacklist]

  ## Path to the file of blocking rules (absolute, or relative to the same directory as the config file)

###########################################################
#        Pattern-based IP blocking (IP blacklists)        #
###########################################################

## IP blacklists are made of one pattern per line. Example of valid patterns:

#   Pattern-based whitelisting (blacklists bypass)   #
######################################################

## Whitelists support the same patterns as blacklists
## If a name matches a whitelist entry, the corresponding session

#        Time access restrictions        #
##########################################

## One or more weekly schedules can be defined here.
## Patterns in the name-based blocklist can optionally be followed with @schedule_name
## to apply the pattern 'schedule_name' only when it matches a time range of that schedule.
##
## For example, the following rule in a blacklist file:
## *.youtube.* @time-to-sleep
## would block access to YouTube during the times defined by the 'time-to-sleep' schedule.
##
## {after='21:00', before= '7:00'} matches 0:00-7:00 and 21:00-0:00

## Remote lists of available servers
## Multiple sources can be used simultaneously, but every source

## Refer to the documentation for URLs of public sources.

## A prefix can be prepended to server names in order to

## different servers. In that case, names listed in `server_names`
## must include the prefixes.
##
## If the `urls` property is missing, cache files and valid signatures

## Routes are indirect ways to reach DNSCrypt servers.
##
## A route maps a server name ("server_name") to one or more relays that will be
## used to connect to that server.
##
## A relay can be specified as a DNS Stamp (either a relay stamp, or a
## DNSCrypt stamp), an IP:port, a hostname:port, or a server name.
##
## The following example routes "example-server-1" via `anon-example-1` or `anon-example-2`,
## and "example-server-2" via the relay whose relay DNS stamp
## is "sdns://gRIxMzcuNzQuMjIzLjIzNDo0NDM".
##
## !!! THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES !!!
##
## Review the list of available relays from the "relays.md" file, and, for each
## server you want to use, define the relays you want connections to go through.
##
## Carefully choose relays and servers so that they are run by different entities.
##
## "server_name" can also be set to "*" to define a default route, but this is not
## recommended. If you do so, keep "server_names" short and distinct from relays.

# routes = [
#    { server_name='example-server-1', via=['anon-example-1', 'anon-example-2'] },
