# Mock SystemCtl Test Results

## Summary
The enhanced mock systemctl approach is working successfully for service management in Docker containers.

## Working Components

### 1. Mock systemctl (`mock-systemctl.sh`)
- ✅ Service start/stop/restart operations
- ✅ Service enable/disable operations  
- ✅ Service status queries
- ✅ daemon-reload operations
- ✅ State tracking in `/var/lib/fake-systemd/`

### 2. Mock Ansible Modules
- ✅ `systemd.py` module successfully overrides built-in systemd module
- ✅ `service.py` module handles service operations
- ✅ Proper return values for Ansible to process

### 3. Service Operations Verified
- ✅ systemd-networkd: started and enabled
- ✅ systemd-resolved: started and enabled  
- ✅ Handler execution: restart systemd-networkd
- ✅ Handler execution: restart systemd-resolved
- ✅ Handler execution: restart iptables

## Provisioning Status
The provisioning gets through all service management tasks successfully but fails later due to an unrelated apt cache issue when installing WireGuard:

```
PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
localhost : ok=50 changed=17 unreachable=0 failed=1 skipped=41 rescued=1 ignored=1
```

## Benefits Demonstrated
1. **No production code changes required** - All mocking is in test infrastructure
2. **Realistic service management** - Mock tracks state and provides expected responses
3. **Handler support** - Service handlers execute successfully
4. **Future-proof** - New service tasks will automatically work

## Remaining Issue
The apt cache update failure in WireGuard installation is unrelated to the mock systemctl implementation and appears to be a Docker/Ansible apt module compatibility issue.
